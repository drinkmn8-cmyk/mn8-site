                rigid routines, or daily mental effort. It doesn’t turn health into a second job or identity project.
                MN8 exists to fit inside a full life not compete with it.

                time-heavy routines, constant tracking, or constant decision-making. It’s for people who want progress
                without disruption, structure without friction, and control without their health becoming their second job.

                If someone needs their system to take over their schedule, dominate their attention, or become their lifestyle,
                MN8 will feel too simple — because it’s designed to fit into life, not replace it.
