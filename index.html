            As responsibility increased, the old system stopped fitting. It required too much time, too much
            planning, and too much attention to survive inside a full schedule. When a system depends on mental
            space that no longer exists, it collapses. That’s why the old approach keeps failing in real life.

                MN8 exists to fit inside a full life not compete with it.

                MN8 is for people who already carry responsibility and don’t have space for complicated health
                systems. It’s built for individuals whose schedules are full, whose days are dense, and whose lives
                don’t allow time-heavy routines, constant tracking, or constant decision-making. It’s for people who
                want progress without disruption, structure without friction, and control without their health
                becoming their second job.

                MN8 is not for people who want their health to become their main focus, their main identity, or their
                main project. It isn’t built for those who enjoy complexity, customization, experimentation, or
                time-intensive routines. If someone needs their system to take over their schedule, dominate their
                attention, or become their lifestyle, MN8 will feel too simple — because it’s designed to fit into
                life, not replace it.

            next steps and private access. If it’s not, nothing moves forward. Just a clean decision based on
            alignment.
