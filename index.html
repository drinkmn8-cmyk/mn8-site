            As responsibility increased, the old system stopped fitting. It required too much time, too
            much planning, and too much attention to survive inside a full schedule. When a system
            depends on mental space that no longer exists, it collapses. That’s why the old approach
            keeps failing in real life.

                rigid routines, or daily mental effort. It doesn’t turn health into a second job or identity
                project. MN8 exists to fit inside a full life not compete with it.

                MN8 is for people who already carry responsibility and don’t have space for complicated health
                systems. It’s built for individuals whose schedules are full, whose days are dense, and whose
                lives don’t allow time-heavy routines, constant tracking, or constant decision-making.<br /><br />
                It’s for people who want progress without disruption, structure without friction, and control
                without their health becoming their second job.

                MN8 is not for people who want their health to become their main focus, their main identity,
                or their main project. It isn’t built for those who enjoy complexity, customization,
                experimentation, or time-intensive routines. If someone needs their system to take over their
                schedule, dominate their attention, or become their lifestyle, MN8 will feel too simple —
                because it’s designed to fit into life, not replace it.
